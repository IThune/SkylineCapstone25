# Zoneminder Cloud NVR Solution #

Zoneminder is a free, open-source CCTV software application suite that allows capture, analysis, recording and monitoring of virtually any security camera. Here are just a few reasons we chose Zoneminder as our NVR solution:

1.  Scalability

    Zoneminder supports multi-server configurations to support performance and reliability with load balancing
    and failover. Zoneminders web interface also makes it a breeze to manage a large number of cameras.

2.  Compatibility

    Zoneminder is compatible with virtually any analog or digital camera on the market. No costly
    vendor lock-in necessary.

3.  Ease of Deployment

    Zoneminder is designed to be easy to use as well as set up. Designed to run on Linux and available in
    major distribution's repositories, Zoneminder can be up and running in just a few short steps.

4.  Commercial Support Options

    With Zoneminder, you will get the best of both being an open-source product as well as access to
    remote technical support at reasonable prices.
